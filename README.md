## Wayne Charrette Comvenient Password Generator

This project is for my third week module. The index.html, the css.stylesheet, and part of the javascript was already provided. The code I am writing out now is just for the remainder.


# Version History

"Initial Commit" just included the initial update with not much to it. Some variables for prompts I ended up not using. 
"Functions and Length" includes the mock ups for the functions (which I don't think I'll change), and the mock up which decides length. 
"Added prompts" - added the series of prompts. Will put in a translate for length to translate to a number instead of a value. 
"Logic for prompts defined" - defines the logic for the prompts. Brings back errors when too short, long, or not a number. \
"Function now brings up prompts" - prompts now propogate when you click the Generate Password button
"redid random characters into strings, password generates" - The password generator is now working! Need to add code, and keep the password generator from returning a all false for the window.confirms.
"added notes to the document" added some final notes to the script.js code. I left in the console.log's even though they're technically redundant. 
"added imgaes to ReadMe" - straight forward, added images

- For fromCharacterCode in Javascript, super helpful guide, though I didn't end up using it. - https://www.net-comber.com/charset.html
- Used a lot of substack for references and helps with code snippets/examples
- Met with tutor Katie Hobbs who helped me work out part of the code, particularly the for loop.
